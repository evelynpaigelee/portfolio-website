        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Caregiving can be an overwhelming and isolating experience. There are many areas of psychological, emotional, relational, financial transition both for the loved one being cared for and the caregiver. As a physical therapist ni the acute care setting, I often see the reality of many individuals and family members have ot become caregivers for their loved one.

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>

        <h2>User Flow</h2>
        <p>
            Based on competitive research and the primary goal of developing an app that connects users to the caregiver community while providing access ot resources and education, | identified the following key functionalities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personalized Profiles: Alow user to select populations and topics to curate suggested content
            </li>
            <li>Communication: Ability to write discussion posts and message other users</li>
            <li>Educational Resources: Informative pages on caregiving topics and health diagnoses</li>
        </ul>

    <div>
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>
            Care & Share is a native app for Oi S and Android, so ti was essential to adhere to both the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and the Android Material Design Guidelines. Iconsidered various factors, including screen sizes, typography, shadows, motion, iconography, navigation, toolbars, and buttons. Using these guidelines, I developed mid-fidelity wireframes for both iOS and Android.
